# OpenContractr
OpenContractr is an OCDS publisher that can be used as a wordpress plugin

Install it like any plugin and then, in the admin, go to Settings -> OpenContractr to edit your organisation/publisher information

To view the OpenContractr interface, simply go to http://mydomain/contracts (replace "mydomain" with the url of your wordpress site)
